<p> Hey, you are visiting my empty website. Isn't that great? Nothing was yet
done on it, but I may write some blog articles here or something. What do
usually people do with websites?
<p> My name is Konrad Borowski. I did work on many projects, including
<a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish shell</a> and
<a href="http://pokemonshowdown.com">Pok√©mon Showdown</a>.
<p> For now, this works as a storage facility, now that I don't really trust
Imgur for image storage purposes, but I hope to use this website for more
interesting stuff in the future.
<p> You may be also interested in <a href="https://github.com/xfix/showdown2irc">
Showdown client that is connected to using IRC</a>, in case you like old
protocols or something.
<p> I also happen to have an <a href="https://github.com/xfix/">account on GitHub</a>.
I'm not a fan of social networking websites, so I don't have an account on those.
